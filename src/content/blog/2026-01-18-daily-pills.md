One of the thing that we need to admit is that we can't get enough substances from just raw materials. For example, no matter how much meat we eat, we can't get enough (or at least cheap) creatine.

Consuming daily (or routine) pills also one of my strategy to keep my life healthy and building a good habit. I still have a lot of bad habits, but by keep doing (or updating) the good habits like this one, I hope the good ones can eventually shadowed the bad ones.

I had discussed with Gemini to give me recommendations. Here's what he said that I should consume:

1.  Vitamin D3 + K22 -> Foundation, for hormonal regulation
    
2.  Fish Oil -> For brain and joints
    
3.  Vitamin B-Complex -> For energy
    
4.  Vitamin D3 -> Better mood, immunity
    
5.  Creatine Monohydrate -> For brain and muscle fuel performance
    
6.  Zinc-Picolinate -> Maintain your testosterone & immunity
    
7.  Magnesium Glycinate -> For better sleep
    
8.  Psyllium Husk -> Stabilizes blood sugar
    

But since I only have a limited budget, below is the list for only the core one:

1.  Creatine Monohydrate -> better brain and body
    
2.  Vitamin D3 -> better mood, immunity, testosterone
    
3.  Vitamin B Complex -> for energy, metabolism
    
4.  Magnesium Glycinate -> better sleep quality
    

With the estimated price, here's the final bill per day:

*   **Creatine:** ~Rp 2,500 / day (5 gr)
    
*   **Vitamin D3:** ~Rp 1,000 / day (1 pill)
    
*   **Vitamin B Complex**: ~ Rp 1,000 / day (1 pill)
    
*   **Magnesium Glycinate:** ~Rp 3,000 / day (1 pill)
    
*   **\==Total**: **~Rp 7,500 per day.** (Cheaper than one coffee at a cafe).**\==**
    

In addition, I also added some nutrients into my daily nutrients list:

*   **Protein**: whey, low-fat milk, soy-milk
    
*   **Probiotic**: Yoghurt
    
*   **Prebiotic:** Fruits (such as papaya)
    
*   **Electrolyte**: sodium/potassium water (with Lemon for better flavor and extra Vit C)
